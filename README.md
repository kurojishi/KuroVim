KuroVim
=======

my personal .vimrc, feel free to use it and modify as you wish


it uses vundle for plugin management and the init can be a bit long

for YouCompleteMe plugin and Syntastic please follow their documentation for a correct setup(use the full installation guide for all the features)

it's still not final, it need a lot of polishing as it's pratically a fork(reorganized and heavily modified) of CrisiVim by crisidev
if you find something that can be improved or removed please set up a issue i'm open to modifications
